# Decision Tree Classifier for Banknote Authentication

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for the task of **Banknote Authentication**. The dataset consists of 1372 instances with 4 numerical features and a binary class label (0: fake, 1: authentic). The goal of this project is to predict the authenticity of banknotes based on these features.

## Features:
- Variance
- Skewness
- Curtosis
- Entropy

## Description
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
3. **Modeling**: A Decision Tree Classifier is implemented to predict the authenticity of banknotes.
4. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
5. **Visualization**: The decision tree is visualized, and feature importance is displayed.

## Instructions to Run the Code

### Requirements:
Make sure to install the following dependencies to run the code:
  - pandas
  - sklearn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

Before running the code, the dataset must be uploaded to the same directory as the .py file. You can access the dataset via the link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication)
